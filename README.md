# Huffman-Decoding-System
Huffman encoding and decoding system. Program calculates huffman letter codes for given input then prints wanted output as given inputs. You must first encode letters then you can choose decode option. Otherwise code will give error. Report is included.

# What are Arguments:
First argument takes ```-i``` or ```-s``` or ```-l```

Second argument takes input sentence

Third argument takes ```encode``` or ```decode```. But this argument necessary if you choose ```-i``` for first argument.

# How to Use:
```-i``` option is getting you into ```encode``` or ```decode``` options.

```-s``` option is shows input letters code

```-l``` option is shows encoded binary tree.
